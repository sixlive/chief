# How Chief Works

Chief is an autonomous coding agent that transforms your requirements into working code, without constant back-and-forth prompting.

::: tip Background
For the motivation behind Chief and a deeper exploration of autonomous coding agents, read the blog post: [Introducing Chief: Autonomous PRD Agent](https://www.geocod.io/code-and-coordinates/2026-02-18-introducing-chief/)

::: info Multi-agent support
Chief supports multiple agent backends: **Claude Code** (default), **Codex CLI**, and **OpenCode CLI**. This page uses "the agent" to refer to whichever backend you've configured. See [Configuration](/reference/configuration) for setup details.

## The Core Concept

Traditional AI coding assistants hit a wall: the context window. As your conversation grows, the AI loses track of earlier details, makes contradictory decisions, or simply runs out of space. Long coding sessions become unwieldy.

Chief takes a different approach using a [Ralph Wiggum loop](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/): **each iteration starts fresh, but nothing is forgotten.**

You describe what you want to build as a series of user stories. Chief works through them one at a time, spawning a fresh agent session for each. Between iterations, Chief persists state to a `progress.md` file: what was built, which files changed, patterns discovered, and context for future work. The next iteration loads this history, giving the agent everything it needs without the baggage of a bloated conversation.

Running `chief` opens a TUI dashboard where you can review your project, then press `s` to start the loop.

## The Execution Loop

Chief works through your stories methodically. Each iteration focuses on a single story:

```
                ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
                │                                       │
                ▼                                       │
        ┌──────────────┐                                │
        │  Pick Story  │                                │
        │  (next todo) │                                │
        └──────┬───────┘                                │
               │                                        │
               ▼                                        │
        ┌──────────────┐                                │
        │ Invoke Agent │                                │
        │  with prompt │                                │
        └──────┬───────┘                                │
               │                                        │

        └──────┬───────┘                                │
               │                                        │
               ▼                                        │
        ┌──────────────┐                                │
        │    Commit    │                                │
        │   changes    │                                │
        └──────┬───────┘                                │
               │                                        │
               ▼                                        │
        ┌──────────────┐           more stories         │
        │ Mark Complete├────────────────────────────────┘
        └──────┬───────┘
               │ all done
               ▼
           ✓ Finished
```

Here's what happens in each step:

1. **Pick Story**: Chief finds the highest-priority incomplete story
2. **Invoke Agent**: Constructs a prompt with the story details and project context, then spawns the agent
3. **Agent Codes**: The agent reads files, writes code, runs tests, and fixes issues until the story is complete
4. **Commit**: The agent commits the changes with a message like `feat: [US-001] - Feature Title`
5. **Mark Complete**: Chief updates the project state and records progress
6. **Repeat**: If more stories remain, the loop continues

This isolation is intentional. If something breaks, you know exactly which story caused it. Each commit represents one complete feature.

## Conventional Commits

Every completed story results in a well-formed commit:

```
feat: [US-003] - Add user authentication

- Implemented login/logout endpoints
- Added JWT token validation
- Created auth middleware
```

Your git history becomes a timeline of features, matching 1:1 with your stories.

## Progress Tracking

The `progress.md` file is what makes fresh context windows possible. After every iteration, the agent appends:

- What was implemented
- Which files changed
- Learnings for future iterations (patterns discovered, gotchas, context)

When the next iteration starts, the agent reads this file and immediately understands the project's history, without needing thousands of tokens of prior conversation. This gives you the benefits of long-running context (consistency, institutional memory) without the downsides (context overflow, degraded performance).

## Worktree Isolation for Parallel PRDs

When running multiple PRDs simultaneously, each PRD can work in its own isolated git worktree. This prevents parallel agent instances from conflicting over files, producing interleaved commits, or stepping on each other's branches.

When you start a PRD, Chief offers to create a worktree:
- A new branch is created (e.g., `chief/auth-system`) from your default branch
- A worktree is set up at `.chief/worktrees/<prd-name>/`
- Any configured setup command runs automatically (e.g., `npm install`)

Each worktree is a full checkout of your project, so the agent can read, write, and run tests independently. When the PRD completes, you can merge the branch back, push it to a remote, or have Chief automatically create a pull request.

The TUI shows branch and directory information throughout:
- **Tab bar**: Branch name next to each PRD tab
- **Dashboard header**: Current branch and working directory
- **PRD picker**: Branch and worktree path for each PRD

## Staying in Control

Autonomous doesn't mean unattended. The TUI lets you:

- **Start / Pause / Stop**: Press `s` to start, `p` to pause after the current story, `x` to stop immediately
- **Review diffs**: Press `d` to see the commit diff for the selected story
- **Edit the PRD**: Press `e` to open the current PRD in the agent for refinement
- **Switch projects**: Press `l` to list PRDs, `n` to create a new one, or `1-9` to jump directly
- **Resume anytime**: Walk away, come back, press `s`. Chief picks up where you left off
- **Merge branches**: Press `m` in the picker to merge a completed branch
- **Clean worktrees**: Press `c` in the picker to remove a worktree and optionally delete the branch
- **Configure settings**: Press `,` to open the Settings overlay
