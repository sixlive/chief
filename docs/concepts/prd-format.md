# PRD Format

Chief uses a structured PRD format with two files: a human-readable markdown file (`prd.md`) and a machine-readable JSON file (`prd.json`). Together, they give Chief everything it needs to autonomously build your feature.

::: info Multi-agent support
Chief supports multiple agent backends: **Claude Code** (default), **Codex CLI**, and **OpenCode CLI**. This page uses "the agent" to refer to whichever backend you've configured. See [Configuration](/reference/configuration) for setup details.
:::

## File Structure

Each PRD lives in its own subdirectory inside `.chief/prds/`:

```
.chief/prds/my-feature/
├── prd.md        # Human-readable context for the agent
├── prd.json      # Structured data Chief reads and updates
├── progress.md   # Auto-generated progress log
└── claude.log    # Raw agent output from each iteration
```

- **`prd.md`** — Written by you. Provides context, background, and guidance.
- **`prd.json`** — The source of truth. Chief reads, updates, and drives execution from this file.
- **`progress.md`** — Written by the agent. Tracks what was done, what changed, and what was learned.
- **`claude.log`** (or `codex.log` / `opencode.log`) — Written by Chief. Raw output from the agent for debugging.

## prd.md — The Human-Readable File

The markdown file is your chance to give the agent context that doesn't fit into structured fields. Write whatever helps the agent understand the project — there's no required format.

### What to Include

- **Overview** — What are you building and why?
- **Technical context** — What stack, frameworks, and patterns does the project use?
- **Design notes** — Any constraints, preferences, or conventions to follow.
- **Examples** — Reference implementations, API shapes, or UI mockups.
- **Links** — Related docs, design files, or prior art.

### Example prd.md

```markdown
# User Authentication System

## Overview
We're building a complete authentication system for our SaaS application.
Users need to register, log in, reset passwords, and manage sessions.

## Technical Context
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Frontend: React with Next.js
- Auth: JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies

## Design Notes
- Follow existing middleware patterns in `src/middleware/`
- Use Zod for input validation (already a dependency)
- All API routes should return consistent error shapes
- Tests use Vitest — run with `npm test`

## Reference
- Existing user model: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- API route pattern: `src/routes/health.ts`
```

This file is included in the agent's context but never parsed programmatically. The agent reads it to understand what you're building and how.

::: tip
The better your `prd.md`, the better the agent's output. Spend time here — it pays off across every story.
:::

## prd.json — The Machine-Readable File

The JSON file is what Chief actually uses to drive execution. It defines the project metadata, optional settings, and an ordered list of user stories.

### Top-Level Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `project` | `string` | Yes | Project name, used in logs and TUI |
| `description` | `string` | Yes | Brief description of what you're building |
| `userStories` | `array` | Yes | Ordered list of user stories |

### UserStory Object

Each story in the `userStories` array has the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | — | Unique identifier (e.g., `US-001`). Appears in commit messages. |
| `title` | `string` | Yes | — | Short, descriptive title. Keep under 50 characters. |
| `description` | `string` | Yes | — | Full description. User story format recommended. |
| `acceptanceCriteria` | `string[]` | Yes | — | List of requirements. The agent uses these to know when the story is done. |
| `priority` | `number` | Yes | — | Execution order. Lower number = higher priority. |
| `passes` | `boolean` | Yes | `false` | Whether the story has been completed and verified. |
| `inProgress` | `boolean` | Yes | `false` | Whether the agent is currently working on this story. |

### Minimal Example

```json
{
  "project": "My Feature",
  "description": "A new feature for my application",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "Basic Setup",
      "description": "As a developer, I want the project scaffolded so I can start building.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Project directory created",
        "Dependencies installed",
        "Dev server starts successfully"
      ],
      "priority": 1,
      "passes": false,
      "inProgress": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Story Selection Logic

Chief picks the next story to work on using a simple, deterministic algorithm:

```
1. Filter stories where passes = false
2. Sort remaining stories by priority (ascending)
3. Pick the first one
4. Set inProgress = true on that story
5. Start the iteration
```

### How Priority Works

Priority is a number where **lower = higher priority**. Chief always picks the lowest-numbered incomplete story:

| Story | Priority | Passes | Selected? |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|
| US-001 | 1 | `true` | No — already complete |
| US-002 | 2 | `false` | **Yes — lowest priority number with passes: false** |
| US-003 | 3 | `false` | No — US-002 goes first |

### What `inProgress` Does

When Chief starts working on a story, it sets `inProgress: true`. This serves as a signal that the story is being actively worked on. When the story completes:

- `passes` is set to `true`
- `inProgress` is set back to `false`

If Chief is interrupted mid-iteration (e.g., you stop it), `inProgress` may remain `true`. On the next run, Chief will pick up the same story and continue.

### Completion Signal

When all stories have `passes: true`, the iteration ends and Chief reports completion. No more iterations are started.

## Annotated Example PRD

Here's a complete `prd.json` with annotations explaining each part:

```json
{
  // The project name — shown in the TUI header and logs
  "project": "User Authentication",

  // A brief description — helps the agent understand scope
  "description": "Complete auth system with login, registration, and password reset",

  "userStories": [
    {
      // Unique ID — appears in commit messages as: feat: [US-001] - User Registration
      "id": "US-001",

      // Short title — keep it under 50 chars for clean commits
      "title": "User Registration",

      // Description — user story format gives the agent clear context
      "description": "As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can access the application.",

      // Acceptance criteria — the agent checks these off as it works
      // Each item should be specific and verifiable
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Registration form with email and password fields",
        "Email format validation",
        "Password minimum 8 characters",
        "Confirmation email sent on registration",
        "User redirected to login after registration"
      ],

      // Priority 1 = done first
      "priority": 1,

      // Chief sets this to true when the story passes all checks
      "passes": false,

      // Chief sets this to true while the agent is working on it
      "inProgress": false
    },
    {
      "id": "US-002",
      "title": "User Login",
      "description": "As a registered user, I want to log in so that I can access my account.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Login form with email and password fields",
        "Error message for invalid credentials",
        "JWT token issued on success",
        "Redirect to dashboard on success"
      ],
      // Priority 2 = done after US-001
      "priority": 2,
      "passes": false,
      "inProgress": false
    },
    {
      "id": "US-003",
      "title": "Password Reset",
      "description": "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can recover my account.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "\"Forgot password\" link on login page",
        "Email with reset link sent to user",
        "Reset token expires after 1 hour",
        "New password form with confirmation field"
      ],
      "priority": 3,
      "passes": false,
      "inProgress": false
    }
  ]
}
```

::: info
JSON doesn't support comments. The annotations above are for illustration only — your actual `prd.json` should be valid JSON without comments.

## Best Practices

### Write Specific Acceptance Criteria

Each criterion should be concrete and verifiable. The agent uses these to determine what to build and when the story is done.

```json
// ✓ Good — specific and testable
"acceptanceCriteria": [
  "Login form with email and password fields",
  "Error message shown for invalid credentials",
  "JWT token stored in httpOnly cookie on success",
  "Redirect to /dashboard after login"
]

// ✗ Bad — vague and subjective
"acceptanceCriteria": [
  "Nice login page",
  "Good error handling",
  "Secure authentication"
]
```

### Keep Stories Small

A story should represent one logical piece of work. If a story has more than 5–7 acceptance criteria, consider splitting it into multiple stories.

**Too large:**
```json
{
  "title": "Complete Authentication System",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Registration form", "Login form", "Password reset",
    "Email verification", "OAuth integration", "Session management",
    "Rate limiting", "Account lockout", "Audit logging"
  ]
}
```

**Better — split into focused stories:**
```json
[
  { "id": "US-001", "title": "User Registration", "priority": 1, ... },
  { "id": "US-002", "title": "User Login", "priority": 2, ... },
  { "id": "US-003", "title": "Password Reset", "priority": 3, ... },
  { "id": "US-004", "title": "OAuth Integration", "priority": 4, ... }
]
```

### Order Stories by Dependency

Use priority to ensure foundational stories are completed before dependent ones. The agent works through stories sequentially, so earlier stories can set up what later stories need.

```json
[
  { "id": "US-001", "title": "Database Schema", "priority": 1 },
  { "id": "US-002", "title": "API Endpoints", "priority": 2 },
  { "id": "US-003", "title": "Frontend Forms", "priority": 3 },
  { "id": "US-004", "title": "Integration Tests", "priority": 4 }
]
```

### Use Consistent ID Patterns

Story IDs appear in commit messages (`feat: [US-001] - User Registration`). Pick a pattern and stick with it:

- `US-001`, `US-002` — generic user stories
- `AUTH-001`, `AUTH-002` — feature-scoped prefixes
- `BUG-001`, `FIX-001` — for bug fix PRDs

### Give the Agent Context in prd.md

The more context you provide in `prd.md`, the better the output. Include:

- What frameworks and tools the project uses
- Where to find existing patterns to follow
- Any constraints or conventions
- What "done" looks like beyond acceptance criteria

### Use `chief new` to Get Started

Running `chief new` scaffolds both files with a template. You can also run `chief edit` to open an existing PRD for editing. This is the easiest way to create a well-structured PRD.
